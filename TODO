Fix known bugs:
    1. save setting and error diag not work correctly.                          DONE.
    2. load setting from disk logic not that perfect. It's just work now.
    3. setting tab h1 not shown D                                               DONE.
    4. path and cwd input support relative path?

Features should be added:
    1. allow configure stdin with user defined variables.                       Done.
    2. output can be used to do something good. (change the selected text, set to clipboard, even pipe to other command, etc)
    3. allow duplicate command(easy, high priority) <=
    4. adapt for crossplatform
    5. i18n
    6. export api as restapi (hard)
    7. import and export command configurations.
    8. Allow search or filter in command list.
    9. Register as obsidian command.
